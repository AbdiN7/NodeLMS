# NodeLMS
An LMS backend Developed using node js
This application allows users to add|delete|update authors and books

# What I Learned
A much deeper understanding of callbacks in javascript, and the power of writing asynchronous code.
This concept after my initial understanding was always hazy, but after building a similar appliaction in Java, doing it in a more functional way using callbacks allowed me to grasp the concept to a much greater degree.

# What's Next
I am excited to to extend this knowlege of writing more asynchronous code to other projects that I will build in the future
