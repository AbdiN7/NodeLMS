# NodeLMS
An LMS backend Developed using node js

# What I Learned
A much deeper understanding of callbacks in javascript, and the power of writing asynchronous code.
This concept after my initial understanding was always hazy, but after building a similar appliaction in JAVA, doing it in a more functional programming way using callbacks allowed me to grasp the concept to a much greater degree.

# What's Next
I am excited to write more APIs using the functional programming paradigm
